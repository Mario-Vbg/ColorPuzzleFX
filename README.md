# ColorPuzzleFX

This is a little Game written with JavaFX (8).
It's a remake of a [game](https://github.com/lestard/ColorPuzzle) I have developed some time ago with Java Swing.

## Run the game

To build the game you need the build system [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) to be installed.
You can then run `gradle run` on the command line to execute the application.

A runnable JAR can be created with `gradle shadowJar`. The JAR file is then located under `build/libs/colorpuzzlefx-all.jar`.
