# ColorPuzzleFX

This is a little Game written with JavaFX (8).
It's a remake of a [game](https://github.com/lestard/ColorPuzzle) I have developed some time ago with Java Swing.


## Run the game

To build the game you need the build system [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) to be installed.
You can then run `gradle run` on the command line to execute the application.

To create executables for your Operating System with `gradle build`. After that
the executables are located in the subdirectory `build/distributions/bundles`.
